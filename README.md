# KNN-Basic-Algorithm
I have put together a basic K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm in python3. Using a Movies dataset, this program will classify the 5 closest movies with the attributes MovieBudget, runtime and year of release.

## KNN Classification
Classifies movies based on MovieBudget, Runtime and Year of release.
